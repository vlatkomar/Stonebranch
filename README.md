This is the description of my solution for the "DreamCandies File Tool" assignment.
The script solution.sh contains the code that solves the problem.
These guidelines need to be respected in order to run the script correctly:
  -the input file(inputok.txt) is passed statically so the filepath must be set correctly 
  -the filepaths of the files used by the script for matching must also be set correctly on the local machine (bigcustomercsvok.txt, biginvoicecsvok.txt and biginvoice_itemok.txt)
