This document describes my solution for the "DreamCandies File Tool" assignment.
The file solution.sh contains is the script that solves the problem.
In order to run correctly the script must be launched with this command:
"bash solution.sh inputok bigcustomercsvok biginvoicecsvok biginvoice_itemcsvok"
The files inputok, bigcustomercsvok, biginvoicecsvok, biginvoice_itemcsvok are provided in the folder.
